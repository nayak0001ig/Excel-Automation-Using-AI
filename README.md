📈 Sample Insights Generated

Mid-distance routes show highest demand pressure.

Certain zones underutilize maximum speed potential.

Launch acceleration increased significantly post-2022.

Some cities dominate origin-based traffic concentration.

High occupancy corridors indicate expansion opportunities.

🌟 Why This Project Stands Out

This is not basic Excel analysis.

It combines:

Data Engineering

Business Intelligence

Visualization Strategy

Executive-Level Presentation

It demonstrates the ability to convert raw operational data into strategic decision-making assets.

📌 Future Enhancements
